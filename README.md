# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System-using-Matlab

This is an assignment for my university. This brain tumor detection system is run on Matlab. The image will undergo several processes of image processing and filtering. For further information and details about this project, you can refer to the ```CSC566 Mini Project Guidelines.pdf```.

## Installation  

### Installation Steps  

1. **Clone this repository**
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Tuanwaf/Video-Games-Recommender-Using-NMF-Collaborative-Filtering.git
   ```

## Important

This project was run in **MATLAB**. If you want the same experience, consider using this environment, too.

## Run the project

1. Before you run the ```BrainTumor_Detection.m```, make sure check the ```BrainTumor_Detection.fig``` for the interface
2. If you want to adjust the interface here ```BrainTumor_Detection.fig```, you can run:
   
   ```
   guide BrainTumor_Detection.fig
   ```
   - Run this inside the command window
     
4. To test the image, inside the ```/BrainTumor_Images``` folder, there are 2 more folders, ```/Yes``` (for brain images that contain a tumor) and ```/No``` (for brain images with no tumor).
5. To test the system, just run the ```BrainTumor_Detection.m``` and upload the folder either ```/Yes``` or ```/No```.
