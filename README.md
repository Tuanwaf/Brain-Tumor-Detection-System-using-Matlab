# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System-using-Matlab

An assignment for my university. This brain tumor detection system is run on Matlab. The image will go through several processess of image processing and filtering

## Installation  

### Installation Steps  

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Tuanwaf/Video-Games-Recommender-Using-NMF-Collaborative-Filtering.git
   ```

## Important

This project was run in **MATLAB**. If you want the same experience, consider using this environment, too.

## Run the project

1. Before you run the ```BrainTumor_Detection.m```, make sure check the ```BrainTumor_Detection.fig``` for the interface
2. If you want to adjust the interface here ```BrainTumor_Detection.fig```, you can run:
   ```
   guide BrainTumor_Detection.fig
   ```
   - Run this inside the command window
3. To test the image, inside the ```/BrainTumor_Images``` folder, there is 2 more folder, ```/Yes``` (for brain images that contain tumor) and ```/No``` (for brain image with no tumor).
4. To test the system, just run the ```BrainTumor_Detection.m``` and upload the folder either ```/Yes``` or ```/No```.
